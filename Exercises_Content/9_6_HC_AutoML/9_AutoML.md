SAP HANA Cloud is enriched with an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approach. AutoML can be helpful, for example, to give a data scientist a head-start into quickly finding a first machine learning model.

A machine learning model is a program that can find patterns or make decisions from a previously unseen dataset. This is made possible by first 'training' the model with a large dataset.
During training, the machine learning algorithm is optimized to find certain patterns or outputs from the dataset, depending on the task. The output of this process - often a computer program with specific rules and data structures - is called a *machine learning model*.

AutoML with SAP HANA Cloud is a great starting point to see what is possible with a dataset, and if it is worth to invest more time into a use case.

- Composite pipeline models of multiple PAL algorithms
- Automated algorithm comparison and selection as well as parameter search and optimal selection ML predictions of higher accuracy/value

</br>

### Productivity up-lift and expert experience

- Expert Data Scientists derive best models in less time/better utilization of compute time to derive best models
- Comparable AutoML expert experience and address trending/competitive capability gap and improve time to maximum value with PAL

For this section, a data set containing customer transactions as a table has already been loaded into the SAP HANA Cloud Database (**GX_TRANSACTIONS**). 

<!-- In this section, we look at a concrete example to see what is possible through this new AutoML approach.  -->

The challenge is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. Such use cases are often quite challenging due to imbalanced data and thus require different techniques before implementing a machine learning model.

### Run process

The **AutoML** approach automatically executes data processing, model fitting, comparison and optimization. 

First, create an **AutoML** classifier object **auto_c** in the following cell. It is helpful to review and set respective [AutoML configuration parameters](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-predictive-analysis-library/automl-d1a54bc3a4664937b77e85a865754b17?locale=en-US)</br>

- The defined scenario will run two iterations of pipeline optimization. The total number of pipelines which will be evaluated is equal to **population_size + generations Ã— offspring_size**. Hence, in this case this amounts to 15 pipelines.
- With **elite_number**, you specify how many of the best pipelines you want to compare.
Setting random_seed =1234 helps to get reproducable **AutoML** runs.


1. Set the maximum runtime for individual pipeline evaluations with the parameter **max_eval_time_mins** or determine if the AutoML shall stop if there are no improvement for the set number of generations with the early_stop parameter. Further, you can set specific performance measures for the optimization with the scoring parameter.

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image022.png)

>**Important!** Change **\<YourName\>** to **{placeholder|userid}** in the **.format()** method.


2. Reinitialize and display the AutoML operators and their parameters.

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image023.png)

>**Note:** A default set of AutoML classification operators and parameters is provided as the global config-dict, which can be adjusted to the needs of the targeted AutoML scenario. Use methods like **update_config_dict, delete_config_dict, display_config_dic** to update the scenario definition.

3. Adjust some of the settings to narrow the searching space. As the resampling method choose the **SMOTETomek** method, since the data is imbalanced.


![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image024.png)


4. Exclude the Transformer methods. As machine learning algorithms keep the Hybrid Gradient Boosting Tree and Multi Logistic Regression.

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image025.png)


5. Set some parameters for the optimization of the algorithms.

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image026.png)


6. Review the complete AutoML configuration for the classification.

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image027.png)


7. Fit the Auto ML scenario on the training data. It may take a couple of minutes. If it takes too long, exclude the **SMOTETomek** in the **resampler()** method of the config file.

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image028.png)

9. Evaluate the best model on the testing data.

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image031.png)

10. Create predictions with your machine learning model.

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image032.png)

![](./Images/DBX_AutoML/image033.png)


12. Save the model through the following command.
